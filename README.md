### Getting started

This is the quick start guide for the front end of TheStudentMaster.

⚠️ Please note that you must already have `Node version >= 21.7.0` installed on your computer to run the program. You also need either an iOS/Android emulator or a corresponding device. This device should also already have Expo installed from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.

#### Installation and Setup

Run the following command to clone the repository:

`git clone https://gitlab.com/themastercollection/thestudentmaster.git`

Once the cloning is complete, change into the project directory:

`cd thestudentmaster`

To start the front end go to the client folder:

`cd Client`

First install all required node packages:

`npm install`

After all packages have been successfully installed, run the following command to start Expo Go:

`npm run start -c`

Now you can scan the QR code shown with your iOS or Android device and the app should open in Expo. With iOS you have to scan the QR code with the camera app and with Android you scan the code directly in the Expo app. For the web version, press `w` in the terminal.

⚠️ Please not that the web version will not compile on windows. This is a known issue.
